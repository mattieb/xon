xon
---

xon is a Python implementation of something I've come to call "XML
Object Notation", or XON. It generally conforms to the ```pickle``
<http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html>`__ protocol, which
means you interact with it using ``load`` and ``dump`` functions.

XON arose out of a need to support XML in web-based APIs that already
support `JSON <http://json.org/>`__, and supports the same vocabulary
that JSON does. It is based on--and, in fact, the test cases come
from--Stefan Goessner's `"Converting Between XML and JSON"
<http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/05/31/converting-between-xml-and-json.html>`__.
If you don't use any of xon's extra options, it is intended to work
exactly like Goessner describes therein:

::

    >>> import xon
    >>> xon.dumps({'foo': {'bar': ['baz', 'quux']}})
    '<foo><bar>baz</bar><bar>quux</bar></foo>'
    >>> xon.loads('<foo><bar>baz</bar><bar>quux</bar></foo>')
    {'foo': {'bar': ['baz', 'quux']}}

Additional options include ``convertvalues``, which will convert
``int``\ s, ``float``\ s, and ``bool``\ s in addition to the default
behavior of handling strings only, and ``wrap``/``unwrap``, which
deals with the root tag so that the ``load`` result and ``dump``
parameters are more like typical JSON objects.
